<summary>❓FAQ</summary>
**Is this will be only 1.21.1?**  
Due to the significant changes introduced to the API in the recent platform update, I have decided to hold the current version at 1.21.1. We will delay the full update migration until the project becomes open source. This will allow the community to contribute to the necessary API adjustments. This approach is better for long-term maintenance: I cannot allocate time to update two or more parallel versions simultaneously. Because of this, it is strategically more efficient to concentrate all future upgrades and new features solely on the newest supported codebase.

**Will upcoming updates break my Shell progress?**  
There’s a small chance. Each update focuses on different systems, and changes to core functionality can sometimes affect saved progress. If that happens, you can re-unlock your lost upgrades in Creative mode. I always try to minimize compatibility issues with every release.

**Why do some upgrades require so many resources?**  
It’s a matter of balance. Some upgrades are designed to be powerful, and their higher cost helps maintain long-term progression and challenge. It also gives players meaningful goals rather than unlocking everything too quickly.

**How long will it stay in Alpha?**  
Roughly 6 months, or until it proves stable across most systems without major bugs, crashes, or exploits. Alpha is focused on testing, collecting feedback, and ensuring a solid foundation before moving into Beta.

**What should we expect in Beta?**  
Beta will focus on expanding and polishing the experience — adding the remaining planned widgets, refining visuals, improving performance, and adjusting balance based on community feedback.

**Does that mean no new widgets in Alpha?**  
Mostly, yes. Until there’s a strong player base capable of testing new widgets thoroughly, I’ll focus on smaller or safer additions that can’t easily break the game. The goal is to keep the build stable while avoiding messy or unbalanced updates.
